;; ## Let the FN begin!
;;
;; Basic building block of Clojure Program is a Function, and in this section we'll cover basic
;; function operations.
(ns defworkshop.simple-functions
  (:require [workshoplib.tdd :refer […]]))

;; ## Clojure basics
;;
;; First, let's figure out a couple of things about Clojure and explain how we're going to handle
;; some things here. Every new task will be started as a function in format of:
;;
;;     (defn task-name
;;        [...]
;;        <here you'll have to write your code>
;;        )
;;
;; We've added the `^:incomplete` hint in order to avoid noise in the unit tests, so that the functions
;; that you haven't yet implemented wouldn't pop out like errors when you're trying to verify currently
;; written ones.


;; Let's first check out how things are defined in Clojure. Following code block will be surrounded by `comment`,
;; which acts like a comment for any syntactically correct code block (symbols and constants aren't checked though,
;; only  proper amount of parantheses.

;;
;; First, let's go through the language primitives (once again).
;;
;; Here's what the string looks like:
;;
;;     "this is a string"
;;
;; Here's an integer:
;;
;;      1
;;
;; Here's a vector
;;
;;      [1 2 3]
;;
;; You can also write it as
;;
;;      [1, 2, 3]
;;
;; if you feel like writing all these commas, they're optional
;;
;; Here's a hash:
;;
;;      {:key "value" :key2 "value2"}
;;
;; This is a keyword:
;;
;;     :key
;;
;; This is a symbol:
;;
;;     'key
;;
;; What you would generally write as 1 + 1 in Clojure is represented like
;;
;;     (+ 1 1)
;;
;; this is called Prefix Notation, it means that operator or function call
;; is always on the first place.
;;
;; In order to define a "variable" in Clojure, you use `def`:
;;
;;     (def a 1)
;;
;; defines `a` as `1`
;;
;; In order to define a function, you should use `defn`:
;;
;;     (defn decrement
;;      [number]
;;      (- number 1))
;;
;; If you want to write a so-called "anonymous function", you can use `def` and `fn`
;; definition, `defn` is mostly a shortcut for combining these two:
;;
;;      (def (fn [number] (- number 1)))
;;
;; If you want to get documentation for certain funciton, you can run:
;;
;;      (clojure.repl/doc defn)
;;
;; in your repl, this will give you infromatione on any function. Since we're going to work
;; with many new functions, this will be particularly useful for you.
;;
;; In case you want to refer to the source of function or macro, you can always use:
;;
;;      (clojure.repl/source defn)
;;
;; Although since most of the Clojure standard library is not as simple as it seems to be, this
;; function is mostly useful for cases when you're working with user libraries
;;
;; In order to suppress evalutation, you can use `quote`:
;;
;;      (quote (println "Hey there!"))
;;
;; You can use `eval` to execute it further down the line:
;;
;;      (eval (quote (println "Hey there!")))
;;
;; And your favorite debugger tool:
;;
;;      (println 123)
;;
;; prints a line with `123`, you can pass arbitrary amount of arguments to `println`

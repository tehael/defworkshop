;; # Tumbling Window

(defn tumbling-window
  "A tumbling window. Tumbling windows (here) have a fixed a-priori known size.

   The idea is simple: using the `let-over-lambda` concept, write a function that has some state
   in closure (vector within the atom).

   Return the function that will add the value it's called with to the buffer, after that check
   wether the buffer is already full (`count` of `@buffer` equals `size`). If it is, fun an `emit-fn`,
   and reset the buffer back to empty vector.

   That's pretty much what the tumbling window looks like:

        t0       t1          t2         (emit)
      +---+  +---+---+  +---+---+---+                 -...-...-...-

      +---+  +---+---+  +---+---+---+                 -...-...-...-

        t3       t4          t5         (emit)
      +---+  +---+---+  +---+---+---+                 -...-...-...-
      | 4 |  | 4 | 5 |  | 4 | 5 | 6 |    <[4 5 6]>    : 4 : 5 : 6 :
